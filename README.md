VR Learning Environment: Revolutionizing Education Through Immersive Learning
Welcome to the **VR Learning Environment** - the next frontier in education technology. We are pioneering a revolution in learning by integrating immersive Virtual Reality (VR) with interactive content to increase engagement, retention, and learning outcomes. This project will be focused on transforming conventional educational paradigms by making learning more interactive, hands-on, and effective for one and for all.

## Overview

The **VR Learning Environment** is not just an educational platform; it is a paradigm shift. By leveraging the power of VR, we present an engaging and interactive learning experience that goes beyond passive consumption to active participation. Imagine instead of students reading through some textbook or watching videos, they can interact with 3D models, explore virtual environments, and solve real-world problems-all within the full immersion of VR.

## Why VR?

Virtual reality offers unparalleled opportunities for learning, including:

- **Enhanced Engagement**: VR puts students into an interactive, 3D world that makes learning fun and engaging. It appeals to multiple senses, creating a more intimate relationship with the content.
- **Better Retention**: Studies indicate that learners retain information more easily when they experience it in an interactive, immersive environment. VR affords learners the ability to handle objects, navigate complex systems, and interact with content in such a way that reinforces learning.
- **Customizable Content**: Our platform enables educators to create customized learning modules that cater specifically to the needs of students, from basic concepts to higher-order thinking.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Our VR environment is compatible with a range of VR headsets and platforms, making it accessible to a broad user base.
## Features

- **Immersive Learning**: Dive into a fully 3D environment where students can manipulate objects, explore virtual worlds, and interact with content in real-time.

- **Interactive Modules**: Engage with hands-on learning modules that promote active participation and practical understanding of subjects.
- **Custom Content**: It is straightforward to create and integrate new learning materials, targeted for various education needs and topics.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on numerous VR headsets and platforms for universal access.
- **High-Performance Optimization**: This project is developed in C and optimized for the best performance/latency for a great user experience.
## Installation

Starting the VR Learning Environment just requires a few easy steps:

1. **Repository Clone:**

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VR-Learning-Environment.git
    cd VR-Learning-Environment
 ```
2. **Install dependencies**:

    Ensure all necessary VR SDKs and libraries are installed. Refer to the `docs/INSTALL.md` for detailed instructions.
3. **Build the project**:

    ```sh
    gcc -I src/core -I src/systems -I src/ui -o VRLearning src/main.c src/core/*.c src/systems/*.c src/ui/*.c -lGL -lGLEW -lglfw -lcurl -lm -ljson-c

    ```
4. **Run the application**:

    ```sh
    ./VRLearning
This will start the application in a windowed mode, which allows for local rendering without the use of a VR headset.

## Usage

Once running, the application can be controlled using the mouse and keyboard to navigate through VR learning modules. Interact with 3D models, solve puzzles, and engage in fun educational activities that provide immersive learning. The platform is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing both educators and learners to focus on the content.

### Local Rendering Tips:

- **Pendulum GUI Rendering**: Pendulum GUI can be rendered locally in a windowed mode. You can click on the pendulum to create a swing or drag it to simulate interaction with your mouse.
- **Input Handling**: Adjust the interaction logic to work with mouse and keyboard inputs instead of VR controllers. For managing the window events and input handling, use SDL2 or GLFW.
