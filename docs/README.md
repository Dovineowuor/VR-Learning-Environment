# VR Learning Environment: Revolutionizing Education Through Immersive Learning

Welcome to the **VR Learning Environment**, a new frontier in education technology. We are pioneering this revolution in learning by bringing together immersive virtual reality (VR) with interactive content for better engagement, retention, and overall learning outcomes. This project will transform educational paradigms into traditional learning, making it far more interactive, hands-on, and effective for any and all.

Overview

The **VR Learning Environment** is not just an educational platform but a paradigm shift. Using the power of VR, we create an engaging and interactive learning experience that moves beyond passive consumption to active participation. Imagine students not just reading textbooks or watching videos but interacting with 3D models, exploring virtual environments, and solving real-world problems-all within a fully immersive VR experience.

## Why VR?

Virtual reality offers unparalleled opportunities for learning:
- **Enhanced Engagement**: VR immerses students in an interactive, 3D world that makes learning fun and engaging. It stimulates multiple senses, fostering a deeper connection with the content.
- **Enhanced Retention**: Studies have found that learners retain information much better when they experience it interactively and in an immersive environment. VR lets learners manipulate objects, navigate through complex systems, and engage with content in a manner that reinforces understanding.
- **Customizable Content**: On our platform, educators can easily create and customize learning modules tailored to the needs of their students-from basic concepts to advanced topics.
Cross-Platform Support: From high-end VR headsets to several VR platforms, our virtual reality environment supports them all and is thus accessible to a wide range of users.

## Features

Immersive Learning: Experience the all-3D virtual world in which the manipulation of objects, navigation in the virtual world, and interaction with content can be performed by students in real-time.
Interactive Modules: Learn with hands-on, engaging modules that foster active learning with an emphasis on practical learning of concepts.
- **Custom Content**: Easily develop and integrate new learning content targeted towards specific learning requirements and topics.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Compatible with numerous VR headsets and platforms for the maximum amount of accessibility by any and all.
- **Performance Optimized**: C is used for low-level, performance-optimized development to assure smooth, responsive interactions.
 
## Installation

Setup the VR Learning Environment with these few easy steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VR-Learning-Environment.git
    cd VR-Learning-Environment
```
2. **Dependencies Installation**:
    Ensure that all the required VR SDKs and libraries are properly installed. For the detailed installation guide, see the `docs/INSTALL.md`.

3. **Project Building**:    

    ```sh
    gcc -I src/core -I src/systems -I src/ui -o VRLearning src/main.c src/core/*.c src/systems/*.c src/ui/*.c -lGL -lGLEW -lglfw -lcurl -lm -ljson-c
    ```
    
4. **Run the application**:
    ```sh
   ./VRLearning
    ```
    
   This will start the application in a windowed mode, which allows for local rendering without the use of a VR headset.

## Usage

Once running, an application can be used by moving through VR learning modules with the mouse and keyboard. Get immersive learning, interact with 3D models, solve interactive puzzles, and participate in a range of engaging learning activities. The platform is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly so educators and learners can simply focus on the content.

### Local Rendering Tips:
- **Pendulum GUI Rendering**: The pendulum GUI should be rendered in a window, locally. You should be able to click on the pendulum to start a swing or even drag it around to simulate interaction via your mouse.
- **Input Handling**: The interaction logic should be changed to handle mouse and keyboard input instead of VR controllers. Use SDL2 or GLFW to handle the window events and process the input.
